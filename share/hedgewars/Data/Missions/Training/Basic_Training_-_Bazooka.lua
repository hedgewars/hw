-- Hedgewars Bazooka Training
-- Scripting Example

-- Lines such as this one are comments - they are ignored
-- by the game, no matter what kind of text is in there.
-- It's also possible to place a comment after some real
-- instruction as you see below. In short, everything
-- following "--" is ignored.

---------------------------------------------------------------
-- At first we implement the localization library using loadfile.
-- This allows us to localize strings without needing to think
-- about translations.
-- We can use the function loc(text) to localize a string.
