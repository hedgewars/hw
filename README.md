Hedgewars - a turn-based strategy game
======================================

Description
-----------
This is the funniest and most addictive game you'll ever play—hilarious fun
that you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. **Hedgewars** is a **turn-based strategy
game** but the real buzz is from watching the **devastation caused by those
pesky hedgehogs** with those fantastic weapons—sneaky little blighters with
a bad attitude!

Each player controls a **team of up to 8 hedgehogs**. During the course of
the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use
whatever tools and weapons are available to **attack and kill the opponents'
hedgehogs**, thereby winning the game.

To destroy your foes you can use one out of **over 40 weapons**!
Launch bazookas or homing bees, drop mines, dynamite or explosive rubber ducks,
throw grenades or watermelon bombs, poison them with stinky cheese, send them
flying with a baseball bat, and much more!

Most weapons cause **explosions that deform the terrain**, removing
circular chunks. Hedgehogs can die by drowning, being thrown off
either side of the arena, or when their health is reduced to zero.

Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by
walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the rope
or parachute, to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each **turn is
time-limited** to ensure that players do not hold up the game with
excessive thinking or moving.

Getting started
---------------
For complete beginners we recommend to start with the the first 2 or 3
missions of the campaign “A Classic Fairytale” in the singleplayer menu.
It explains the basic controls and gameplay.

Note that Hedgewars doesn't have a *complete* tutorial yet, but it is
planned to create one in future versions.
