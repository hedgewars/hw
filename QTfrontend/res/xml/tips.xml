    <tip>Simply pick the same color as a friend to play together as a team. Each of you will still control his or her own hedgehogs but they'll win or lose together.</tip>
    <tip>Some weapons might do only low damage but they can be a lot more devastating in the right situation. Try to use the Desert Eagle to knock multiple hedgehogs into the water.</tip>
    <tip>If you're unsure what to do and don't want to waste ammo, skip one round. But don't let too much time pass as there will be Sudden Death!</tip>
    <tip>Want to save ropes? Release the rope in mid air and then shoot again. As long as you don't touch the ground you'll reuse your rope without wasting ammo!</tip>

    <tip>By default the game will always record the last game played as a demo. Select 'Local Game' and pick the 'Demos' button on the lower right corner to play or manage them.</tip>

    <tip>Hedgewars can be perfect for short games during breaks. Just ensure you don't add too many hedgehogs or use an huge map. Reducing time and health might help as well.</tip>
    <tip>No hedgehogs were harmed in making this game.</tip>
    <tip>There are three different jumps available. Tap [high jump] twice to do a very high/backwards jump.</tip>
    <tip>Afraid of falling off a cliff? Hold down [precise] to turn [left] or [right] without actually moving.</tip>
    <tip>Some weapons require special strategies or just lots of training, so don't give up on a particular tool if you miss an enemy once.</tip>
    <tip>Most weapons won't work once they touch the water. The Homing Bee as well as the Cake are exceptions to this.</tip>
    <tip>The Old Limbuger only causes a small explosion. However the wind affected smelly cloud can poison lots of hogs at once.</tip>
    <tip>The Piano Strike is the most damaging air strike. You'll lose the hedgehog performing it, so there's a huge downside as well.</tip>
    <tip>The Homing Bee can be tricky to use. Its turn radius depends on its velocity, so try to not use full power.</tip>
    <tip>Sticky Mines are a perfect tool to create small chain reactions knocking enemy hedgehogs into dire situations ... or water.</tip>
    <tip>The Hammer is most effective when used on bridges or girders. Hit hogs will just break through the ground.</tip>
    <tip>If you're stuck behind an enemy hedgehog, use the Hammer to free yourself without getting damaged by an explosion.</tip>
    <tip>The Cake's maximum walking distance depends on the ground it has to pass. Use [attack] to detonate it early.</tip>
    <tip>The Flame Thrower is a weapon but it can be used for tunnel digging as well.</tip>
    <tip>Use the Molotov or Flame Thrower to temporary keep hedgehogs from passing terrain such as tunnels or platforms.</tip>
